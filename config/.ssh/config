# This set up allows me to only enter the ssh key passphrase once and it will be remembered automatically.
# When generating the ssh key, setting a passphrase is important so
# even if a bad actor gets access to the private key, they can't use it without the knowing the passphrase
#
# After generating the key, run `ssh-add --apple-use-keychain ~/.ssh/id_ed25519` to add it to Apple Keychain.
# ATTENTION: replace `id_ed25519` by whatever name you gave to your key file.
