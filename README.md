# Prerequisites

Install the following programs before running this script:

- iTerm2
- stow (`brew install stow`)
- coreutils (`brew install coreutils`)
- ctags (`brew install ctags`)

# Install

First, clone this repository at `~/` (otherwise you might have issues with stow):

```bash
cd ~/
git clone git@github.com:glaucocustodio/dotfiles.git
```

Then run the setup script:

```bash
cd ~/dotfiles
chmod +x script/setup
script/setup
```

# Available make tasks

Once you change a dotfile at `config/`, the changes will automatically be reflected at the respective file in `~/` (because of the sym link).

If for some reason you wanna link the files again, run:

```bash
make update
```

To delete all dotfiles run:

```bash
make remove
```
